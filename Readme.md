## Advanced Prompt Engineering

In the `src/amie_prompt_engine.js` file, you'll find the logic that dynamically selects and adjusts prompts based on context and user interactions. This module:
- Integrates with GPT-4 and Anthropic Claude.
- Uses advanced techniques such as prompt chaining and context injection to guide the conversation.
- Optimizes prompts to reduce ambiguity and improve the coherence of model responses.

### Example Prompt

For instance, one optimized prompt for Amie might be:

> "You are Amie, a compassionate SEL assistant. A user has just mentioned they feel anxious about an upcoming exam. Provide supportive advice that is both empathetic and actionable."

This prompt is engineered to include clear context, tone expectations, and actionable guidanceâ€”leading to higher quality responses.

## A/B Testing & Performance Analysis

This repository includes an A/B testing framework (see `examples/ab_test_samples.js`) where different prompt variations are evaluated. The results, detailed in `docs/ab_testing_results.md`, cover:
- **Response Quality:** Clarity, relevance, and empathy in responses.
- **Engagement Metrics:** User feedback and interaction times.
- **Model Efficiency:** Token usage and response latency.

These insights help refine our prompt strategies and inform future improvements.
