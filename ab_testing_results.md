# A/B Testing Results for Prompt Engineering

## Overview

This document summarizes the outcomes of our A/B testing for prompt engineering in the Amie chatbot. We evaluated multiple prompt variations to determine which strategy best produces high-quality, empathetic, and actionable responses.

## Testing Metrics

- **Response Quality:** Clarity, empathy, and actionable advice.
- **Engagement Metrics:** User feedback and interaction times (simulated).
- **Model Efficiency:** Token usage and response latency.

## Prompt Variants Tested

1. **Variant A: Standard Prompt**  
   *Prompt:*  
   "You are Amie, a compassionate SEL assistant. A user has mentioned they feel anxious about an upcoming exam. Provide supportive advice that is both empathetic and actionable."

2. **Variant B: Alternative Tone with Context**  
   *Prompt:*  
   "You are Amie, a caring and understanding assistant specialized in SEL. A user is anxious about an upcoming exam due to multiple deadlines. Offer practical and warm advice to help manage stress."

3. **Variant C: Rich Context Injection**  
   *Prompt:*  
   "You are Amie, a friendly SEL assistant known for insightful advice. A student explains that they are anxious about an exam and overwhelmed by their workload. Provide clear, empathetic, and step-by-step guidance on reducing stress and organizing tasks."

## Observations

- **Variant A:**  
  - *Strengths:* Direct and clear, producing concise responses.  
  - *Weaknesses:* Lacks detailed context that may further personalize advice.
  - *Performance:* Average response time and token usage.

- **Variant B:**  
  - *Strengths:* Warmer tone; adds some contextual detail leading to more engaging responses.
  - *Weaknesses:* Slightly longer responses.
  - *Performance:* Comparable response time; moderate token usage.

- **Variant C:**  
  - *Strengths:* Provides rich context resulting in highly personalized and actionable guidance.
  - *Weaknesses:* Slightly higher token usage and response latency.
  - *Performance:* Highest token usage; best quality response overall.

## Conclusion

Variant C proved to deliver the most empathetic and actionable responses, though at the cost of slightly increased response time. Future improvements could involve optimizing context length to balance quality and efficiency.
